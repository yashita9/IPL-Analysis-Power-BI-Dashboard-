IPL Data Analysis Dashboard

📊 Project Overview
I built an interactive IPL Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, leveraging powerful visualizations and dynamic insights to explore cricket match statistics. The project utilizes DAX expressions for complex calculations and is connected to a SQL Server database for real-time data updates.
The dashboard can also be connected to alternative data sources like Excel or PostgreSQL.

🚀 Features
Dynamic Visualizations: Match scores, player stats, team performance, and more.
DAX Calculations: Custom metrics, aggregates, and calculated columns.
Flexible Data Connections: SQL Server, Excel, PostgreSQL.
Interactive Filters: Slice and dice data by teams, seasons, and players.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Power BI: For building and designing the dashboard.
SQL Server: Primary data source (can also use Excel or PostgreSQL).
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For data manipulation and advanced calculations.

🚩 Future Improvements
Adding predictive analytics with Python.
Integrating live match data via APIs.
Enhancing visuals with custom Power BI themes.
